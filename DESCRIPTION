Description: Functions to quickly generate reports about CAGE libraries.
 WARNING: this package is available to the public, but at the moment it
 is strongly tied to our work environment at RIKEN, so there is no
 guarantee that you will not waste your time with it.  In addition, some
 of the code here was not written to be durable, but rather to quickly
 produce results.
 .
 We use this package to analyse libraries that are prepared to test and
 develop our CAGE protocols.  It assume a depth of sequencing typical of
 the MiSeq instrument, and is guaranteed to work harmless on bigger data
 produced by HiSeqs.
