The files used here are fluorometric measurements (PicoGreen assays) of cDNA
yield after C1 runs.  They are using templates provided by Fluidigm. See also
our [GitHub page][] or the function from the `fldgmPicoGreen` function from
the [smallCAGEqc][] R package.

Standard curves in fluorometric (“PicoGreen”) measurements
==========================================================

## Read the data

```{r}
read_sc <- function(RUN) {
  FILE <- paste(RUN, "picogreen.xlsx", sep = ".")
  sc <- smallCAGEqc::fldgmPicoGreenStdCurve(FILE)
  sc <- cbind(Run=RUN, sc)
  return(sc)
}

sc <- Reduce( function(x,y) rbind(x, read_sc(y))
            , RUNS
            , data.frame())

```

## Fit a linear model

### Plot  on a natural scale

```{r standard-curves_natural, dev=c("png", "svg"), warning=FALSE}
ggplot(
  sc,
  aes(
    x=DNA,
    y=Fluorescence,
    colour=Run)
) + geom_point() +
    geom_line() + 
    scale_x_continuous('DNA concentration (ng/\u03BCL)') +
    scale_y_continuous('Average fluorescence (background subtracted)')
```

The point at highest DNA concentration is often outside the linear dynamic
range.  Therefore, let's exclude it from the linear modeling.

### Weighted linear model of the standard curves.

```{r linear-model, dev=c("png", "svg")}
models <- sc[c("DNA","Fluorescence")] %>%
  split(sc$Run) %>%
  lapply(
    function(X) {
      l <- lm( Fluorescence ~ DNA, X
             , weight = 1 / DNA
             , subset = 2:10)
      c( Intercept = l$coefficients["(Intercept)"] %>% unname
       , Slope     = l$coefficients["DNA"] %>% unname
       , r.squared = summary(l)$r.squared)}) %>%
  data.frame(check.names=F) %>%
  t %>%
  data.frame
models
```

### Plot on a natural scale, normalised to arbitrary units

```{r standard-curves_natural_normalised, dev=c("png", "svg"), warning=FALSE}
sc$Fnorm <- sc$Fluorescence / models[sc$Run, "Slope"]
ggplot(
  sc,
  aes(
    x=DNA,
    y=Fnorm,
    colour=Run)
) + geom_point() +
    geom_line() + 
    scale_x_continuous('DNA concentration (ng/\u03BCL)') +
    scale_y_continuous('Arbitrary fluorescence (background subtracted)')
```

## Intercept at zero ng of DNA

Note that in the values used here, the background was already subtracted.
Thus, fluorescence intensity should be very close to zero at DNA concentration
zero, unless there are remaining technical errors (which will be discussed
in a section below).

In the plot below, the intercept values have been normalised by the slopes.
They are spread on the horizontal axis according to the r-squared value of
the linear model that was fit.

```{r fit-curves, dev=c("png", "svg")}
qplot( r.squared
     , Intercept / Slope
     , data = models
     , colour = rownames(models)) + theme_bw()
```

## Visualisation on a log-log scale

A plot on a log-log scale will also reveal if there is background: in that
case the plot would reach a plateau at low the lowest concentrations.

In the plot below, a vertical shift indicates that a given mass of DNA was
yielding higher fluorescence values.  Indeed, the two outliers (1772-123-237
and 1772-123-238) were measured on a more recent machine with fresh reagents.

```{r standard-curves, dev=c("png", "svg"), warning=FALSE}
ggplot(
  sc,
  aes(
    x=DNA,
    y=Fluorescence,
    colour=Run)
) + geom_point() +
    geom_line() + 
    scale_x_log10('DNA concentration (ng/\u03BCL)') +
    scale_y_log10('Average fluorescence (background subtracted)') +
    theme_bw()
```



Dilution factors
----------------

Because the standard curve was prepared by 2-fold serial dilution, the
fluorescence should be divided by two between each measurement.

Excluding the first measurement at highest DNA concentration (see
above) as well at the one at lowest concentration, that sometimes gives
negative values.

```{r dilution_factors, dev=c("png", "svg")}
models$dil <- tapply( sc$Fluorescence
                    , sc$Run
                    , function(X) mean(X[2:8] / X[3:9]))
models[["dil"]] %>% hist(main = "Measured dilution factors")
```

Most of the error in the standard curves is explained by technical
variability in the dilution factors.

```{r df_intercept, dev=c("png", "svg")}
plot( models$Intercept / models$Slope
    , models$dil
    , xlab = "Intercept (normalised by slope)"
    , ylab = "Dilution factor"
    , main = "Relation between intercept and dilution factor")
abline(h=2, col="gray")
abline(v=0, col="gray")
```


Linear fits for each run.
-------------------------

 - Black: data;
 - Red: weighted linear regression (used above);
 - Blue: linear regression;
 - Green: "robust" linear regression.

```{r show_fits, dev=c("png", "svg")}
byRun <- sc[c("DNA","Fluorescence")] %>%
  split(sc$Run)

plotFit <- function(name, x) {
  l  <- lm(Fluorescence ~ DNA, x, subset = 2:10)
  lw <- lm(Fluorescence ~ DNA, x, weights = 1 / DNA, subset = 2:10)
  lr <- MASS::rlm(Fluorescence ~ DNA, x, subset = 2:10)

  plot( x$DNA
      , x$Fluorescence
      , log = "xy"
      , type="b"
      , main=name
      , xlab = "DNA"
      , ylab = "Fluorescence"
      , las = 1)
  lines(x$DNA[2:10], predict(l), col="blue")
  lines(x$DNA[2:10], predict(lr), col="green")
  lines(x$DNA[2:10], predict(lw), col="red")
}

plyr::l_ply(names(byRun), function(X) plotFit(X, byRun[[X]]))
```
