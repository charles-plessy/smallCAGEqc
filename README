smallCAGEqc
===========

smallCAGEqc is a R package collecting scripts for the analysis of transcriptome
libraries at RIKEN CLST/DGT ex-OSC.  It makes strong assumptions on our
infrastructure and hardcodes paths for key files, therefore it does not make
sense to share it to the public.

To install smallCAGEqc on a linux system, retreive the source code with Git as
follows:

```
git clone osc-ac2.gsc.riken.jp:/osc-fs_home/plessy/git/R/smallCAGEqc.git
```

Then install the R package locally.

```
R CMD INSTALL smallCAGEqc
```

In case of error `no permission to install to directory 
‘/usr/local/lib/R/site-library’`, create a local R directory with the following 
command.

```
/usr/bin/Rscript -e 'dir.create(Sys.getenv("R_LIBS_USER"), recursive=TRUE)'
````

That's it !  Of course, `git` and `R` must be already installed on your system,
as well as the R packages needed by smallCAGEqc (see the `Depends` line of the
[DESCRIPTION][] file).

On Mac it should be similar, and on Windows I recommend to install a Linux
virtual machine.
